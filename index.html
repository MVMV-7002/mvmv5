	Introduction: While the A80 Supra was technically part of the same generation as the A70 in Japan, it was the <br>
	definitive model for the 1990s and beyond, remaining in production for a decade. After a long hiatus, <br>
	Toyota reintroduced the Supra in 2020 as a part of a joint project with BMW (which gave birth to the Z4).<br><br>
	
	Engine: The A80's legendary 2JZ-GTE engine returned, and it became known for its incredible tuning potential. <br>
	Toyota also offered a naturally aspirated version with the 2JZ-GE.<br><br>
	
	Key Features: The A80 was known for its striking design, immense performance, and excellent handling. It became a <br>
	true icon, popularized in part by its role in "The Fast and the Furious" movie franchise. The Mark V was also a huge leap, <br>
	combining BMW's engineering with Toyota's performance ethos.<br>
	Modern Rebirth (2020-Present): The 2020 A90 Supra (Mark V) was reborn with a BMW engine (B58 3.0L inline-six). The car returned with <br>
	modern tech, improved handling, and performance. It's a hybrid of Toyota engineering and BMW's design philosophy, with the Supra receiving <br>
	updates in 2023, focusing on improving driving dynamics and tech.	<br>
